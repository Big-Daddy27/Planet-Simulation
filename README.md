# Planet-Simulation:
  It is a simulation of planets revolving around the sun in our solar system. I have tried to use real astronomical values but at some places I had to approximate so     as to fit them on the screen.
# Languages used:
  # It is entirely written on Python:
    Used the pygame library
// You can install pygame using the following steps:-
   1) Go to your command prompt
   2) Write " pip install pygame"
